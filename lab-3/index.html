          Handsome Jack is the main antagonist of Borderlands 2, and the
          deuteragonist of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. He has taken over the
          Hyperion corporation, declared himself dictator of Pandora, and stolen
          all of the credit for finding The Vault, going so far as to claim
          responsibility for killing The Destroyer. A new team of Vault Hunters
          is tasked with killing Jack and restoring (relative) peace to Pandora.

          Jack placed Helios, an enormous geostationary space station, in the
          Lagrange point between Pandora and its moon, Elpis. It acts as an
          homage to his ego as well as a supply base from which he can send
          supplies and troops down to Pandora. The satellite also has a lens
          that allows Jack to keep an eye on the Vault Hunters at all times.

          Borderlands 2 is a 2012 first-person shooter video game developed by
          Gearbox Software and published by 2K. Taking place five years
          following the events of Borderlands (2009), the game is again set on
          the planet of Pandora. The story follows a new group of Vault Hunters
          who must ally with the Crimson Raiders, a resistance group made up of
          civilian survivors and guerrilla fighters, to defeat the tyrannical
          Handsome Jack before he can unlock the power of a new Vault. The game
          features the ability to explore the in-game world and complete main
          missions and optional side quests, either in offline splitscreen,
          single-player or online cooperative gameplay. Like its predecessor,
          the game features a procedurally generated loot system which is
          capable of generating numerous combinations of weapons and other gear.
